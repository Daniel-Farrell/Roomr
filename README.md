# Roomr
A website to match users with other users who have similar interests in living spaces.

This project is going to be used to showcase my skills in frontend web development languages such as HTML, CSS & Javascript. I will also use this project as a method of learning skills such as Bootstrap, Angular and any other relevant frameworks due to their popularity in most job recruitment advertisements online.
